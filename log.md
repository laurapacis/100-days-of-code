# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created MongoDB account and my first cluster and collection/database, which I connected to a backend server on my computer. Also re-started my JavaScript training from the basics. I am using the Edabit exercises. This JavaScript training aims to be the groundwork for my 100daysofcode, with the goal of achieving a solid foundation of knowledge that I am lacking at the moment.

**Thoughts:** I decided to start this challenge to consolidate my JavaScript skills, because I'm not happy with my performance. I've kept learning new things like React and now Express, but my JS foundations are not solid, and obviously this is becoming problematic. Already now I feel much more motivated to work hard for the next 100 days. The power of accountability!

### Day 2: March 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: CRUD MongoDB methods: .find() .findOne() and .insertOne(). Also JS training on String Methods.

**Thoughts:** So far I like MongoDB and backend. For some reason it makes me feel calm.

### Day 3: March 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practice with router, routes and middleware (ExpressJS). Also JS training on CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** Really busy day. I've spent more than 10 hours in front of the computer... my eyes hurt x_x

### Day 4: March 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: First time using SQL (on an online playground) + ATLAS (MongoDB cloud database) manipulation through Compass (DB UI tool) + Started with Mongoose

**Thoughts:** I wish I hadn't spent so much time installing MongoDB locally, so I could have practiced more SQL.

**Link to work:** [My first SQL table](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/92dbbb/7)

### Day 5: March 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practice with Mongoose: outsourcing models and schemas, working with CRUD routes using different methods.

**Thoughts:** I love being able to hyper-focus and spend the day in front of the computer but it's not going to be good for the long run. I've been feeling a bit unfit lately and I don't like it. From now on, the more I work the more I will workout.

### Day 6: March 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practice JS array methods on Codewars. Also brainstorming about two projects ideas.

**Thoughts:** I didn't do much coding today. I feel a bit bad about it but I guess it's okay. It was a productive day in other ways though.

**Link to work:** Nothing to link

### Day 7: March 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Three.js reading its docs and browsing through some tutorials.

**Thoughts**: I wish I could have spent more time coding today, Three.js is so rad!! <3

**Link to work**: Nothing to link

### Day 8: March 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learnt how to create a basic scene with Three.js (scene, mesh, camera, renderer).

**Thoughts** After browsing through some disappointing courses/tutorials I finally decided to give [three.js journey](https://threejs-journey.xyz/) by [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com/) a try and so far, so great! Even though I am not so sure this is the best time for me to learn Three.js, I feel so thrilled about it!

**Link to work**: Nothing to link

### Day 9: March 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Mongoose Virtuals and Serving static files in Express.

**Thoughts**: I have the feeling that today wasn't productive at all. Maybe because all what I wanted to do was learning more Three.js and I didn't have time (and energy) for it. On the other hand, the highlight of the day was the code review from R., because he really took the time to make it meaningful. Sometimes, seeing other people do things right makes me inspired.

### Day 10: March 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Seeding a database with Faker.js + Basics of Webpack

**Thoughts**: Today in class we started a group project, a fullstack application for a Record Store. Besides that: good time managment today :woman-juggling: I am feeling happy and tired.

### Day 11: March 17, 2021

### Day 12: March 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn Bulma today (I still prefer Semantic UI).

**Thoughts**: More group work during the day. I like these group projects because they push me out of my comfort zone + improve my soft skills. Today's ReDI class was specially nice because the students did their first long(er) individual projects and by supporting them in their work I was reminded of where I started and where I am now.

### Day 13: March 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Authentication with hashing, salt and bcrypt <3

**Today's Progress**: Updated my portfolio and finished CV. Learnt the difference between node.js require and ES6 import and export. Also sent my first job application!

**Thoughts**: We started mentoring at DCI as well. Still a bit early to have an opinion about it. After working with ES6 import and export in my backend for the first time, I kind of still prefer node.js require. PS: The job search makes me super excited.
