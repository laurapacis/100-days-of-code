# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created MongoDB account and my first database, which I connected to a backend server on my computer. Also re-started my JavaScript training from the basics. I am using the Edabit exercises. This JavaScript training aims to be the groundwork for my 100daysofcode, with the goal of achieving a solid foundation of knowledge that I am lacking at the moment.

**Thoughts:** I decided to start this challenge to consolidate my JavaScript skills, because I'm not happy with my performance. I've kept learning new things like React and now Express, but my JS foundations are not solid, and obviously this is becoming problematic. So I'm glad I decided to start this challenge. Already now I feel much more motivated to work hard for the next 100 days. The power of accountability!

### Day 2: March 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: CRUD MongoDB methods: .find() .findOne() and .insertOne(). Also JS training on String Methods.

**Thoughts:** So far I like MongoDB and backend. For some reason it makes me feel calm.
