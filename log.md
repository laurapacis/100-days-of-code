# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created MongoDB account and my first cluster and collection/database, which I connected to a backend server on my computer. Also re-started my JavaScript training from the basics. I am using the Edabit exercises. This JavaScript training aims to be the groundwork for my 100daysofcode, with the goal of achieving a solid foundation of knowledge that I am lacking at the moment.

**Thoughts:** I decided to start this challenge to consolidate my JavaScript skills, because I'm not happy with my performance. I've kept learning new things like React and now Express, but my JS foundations are not solid, and obviously this is becoming problematic. So I'm glad I decided to start this challenge. Already now I feel much more motivated to work hard for the next 100 days. The power of accountability!

### Day 2: March 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: CRUD MongoDB methods: .find() .findOne() and .insertOne(). Also JS training on String Methods.

**Thoughts:** So far I like MongoDB and backend. For some reason it makes me feel calm.

### Day 3: March 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practice with router, routes and middleware (ExpressJS). Also JS training on CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** Really busy day. I've spent more than 10 hours in front of the computer... my eyes hurt x_x

### Day 4: March 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: First time using SQL (on an online playground) + ATLAS (MongoDB cloud database) manipulation through Compass (DB UI tool) + Started with Mongoose

**Thoughts:** I wish I hadn't spent so much time installing MongoDB locally, so I could have practiced more SQL.

### Day 5: March 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practice with Mongoose: outsourcing models and schemas, working with CRUD routes using different methods.

**Thoughts:** I love being able to hyper-focus and spend the day in front of the computer but it's not going to be good for the long run. I've been feeling a bit unfit lately and I don't like it. From now on, the more I work the more I will workout.

### Day 6: March 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practice JS array methods on Codewars. Also brainstorming about two projects ideas.

**Thoughts:** I didn't do much coding today. I feel a bit bad about it but I guess it's okay. It was a productive day in other ways though.
